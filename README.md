# The-Odin-Project is an open-source curriculum for learning full-stack web development.

Come follow me on my journey and progress on working towards becoming a full-stack web developer! In this curriculum, I will be learning HTML, CSS, and Javascript foundamentals as well as be exploring the intricacies of backend development through Node.js, Express.js, and MongoDB. I will be building and tweaking many different projects here using different frameworks and libraries.
